Movie Trailers
================

This is a sample project for Udacity's "Programming Foundations" cource, and the Full Stack Web Dev nanodegree.
It's a project that uses python to explore the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP), and get a taste programming for the web.
This application statically stores a list of Movie() objects, and using attributes like youtube_trailer, and poster_art, generate a static web page to display them.  It relies on a fork of Udacity's 'fresh_tomatoes.py' module to generate the html page. The HTML page is using Bootstrap and   The orginal source of this can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode)

As a side function, when the python module is run from a terminal, any movie that shows up on the web page, will also have it's name and description outputed to the terminal.
