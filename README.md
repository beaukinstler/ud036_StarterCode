Movie Trailers
================

This is a sample project for Udacity's "Programming Foundations" cource, and the Full Stack Web Dev nanodegree.
It's a project that uses python to explore the concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP), and get a taste programming for the web.
This application statically stores a list of Movie() objects, and using attributes like youtube_trailer, and poster_art, generate a static web page to display them.  It relies on a fork of Udacity's 'fresh_tomatoes.py' module to generate the html page. The HTML page is using Bootstrap and   The orginal source of this can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode)

As a side function, when the python module is run from a terminal, any movie that shows up on the web page, will also have it's name and description outputed to the terminal.

Getting Started
---------------

Some of this will be compatible with both python 2.7 and 3.2, but the course is designed for 2.7. If you're trying some of this code, and it's not working, make sure you're using 2.7

Usage
-----

1. Download and unzip the files in this [zip file](https://github.com/beaukinstler/ud036_StarterCode/archive/master.zip), or clone with `$ git clone git@github.com:beaukinstler/ud036_StarterCode.git`
1. `cd` into the 'ud036_StarterCode' folder.
1. Edit the "entertainment_center.py" file.
    * The movies can be changed in the `make_list_of_movies()` function.
    * NOTE: You must create a Movie() object for each movie that you want to include.
1. Ensure all the movie instances have also been added to the `movies_list` array, if you want them show up on the web page.
1. run the entertainment_center.py file.
    * In most steups, with python installed, you should be able to run this command from the folder with this code
        > `$ python entertainment_center.py`
    * This will run the code, create a `fresh_tomatoes.html` file in the working directory, and launch a web browser to read the file.
